On the other hand, in a Linked List, each node only knows about the next and previous nodes, not the relative position of other nodes. So, to access a specific element in a Linked List, you have to traverse through the list from the head, which has a time complexity of O(n).",1.486144781112671

In an array, elements are stored contiguously in memory, which allows for efficient random access. When you need to access an element at a specific index, the CPU can simply calculate the memory address of that element and retrieve it directly. This operation is typically very fast, taking constant time regardless of the size of the array.

In contrast, linked lists store elements as separate objects with pointers to the next element in the list. When you need to access an element in a linked list, the CPU has to follow the pointers from the beginning of the list to find the desired element, which can be slower than accessing an array directly.

Therefore, for random access, arrays are typically preferred over linked lists due to their faster access times.",1.274266004562378
